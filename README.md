## Installation Steps:  

1. Download the latest release [>> HERE <<](https://github.com/Tavris1/ComfyUI-Easy-Install/releases/latest/download/ComfyUI-Easy-Install.zip).  
2. Extract the ZIP file into a new folder..  
**DO NOT** use system folders like **`Program Files`**, **`Windows`** or system root **`C:\`**  
3. Run **`"ComfyUI-Easy-Install.bat"`**  
   or **`"ComfyUI-Easy-Install for RTX 50x.bat"`**  if you have 5060, 5070, 5080 or 5090 GPU
  - After installation, you can rename or move **`"ComfyUI-Easy-Install"`** folder if needed.  
  - This installation does not affect existing ComfyUI installations in any way.  
  This way you can have multiple installations in different folders.  

## Tips for Existing Installations:  
- To preserve settings from other ComfyUI installations, place the following files in the same folder as the installer.  
They will be copied automatically to the appropriate folders:  
      - `run_nvidia_gpu.bat`  
      - `extra_model_paths.yaml` (refer to **Extra Model Paths Maker üî•**)  
      - `comfy.settings.json` (user/default)  
      - `was_suite_config.json` (custom_nodes/was-node-suite-comfyui)  
      - `rgthree_config.json` (custom_nodes/rgthree-comfy)

## Extra Model Paths Maker üî•  

### How to Use:  
1. Place **Extra_Model_Paths_Maker.bat** in your existing **models** folder and run it.  
       - This generates an organized `extra_model_paths.yaml` listing all subfolders in the directory.  
2. Move `extra_model_paths.yaml` to your new **ComfyUI** folder.  
       - This allows ComfyUI to use your existing model files without additional downloads.  

> **Note**: Some folders like **LLM** and **llm_gguf** cannot be redirected this way.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning!** If three nodes fail to load after the latest ComfyUI update, run this command in the python_embedded folder:
```bash
.\python.exe -m pip uninstall xformers
```
