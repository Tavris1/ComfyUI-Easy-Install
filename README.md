## Installation Steps:  

1. Download the latest release from [HERE](https://github.com/Tavris1/ComfyUI-Easy-Install/releases/latest/download/ComfyUI-Easy-Install.zip).  
2. Extract the ZIP file to your desired folder.  
**DO NOT** use system folders like **`Program Files`**, **`Windows`** or system root **`C:\`**  
3. Run **ComfyUI-Easy-Install.bat**.  
- After installation, you can rename or move **ComfyUI_windows_portable** folder if needed.  

## Tips for Existing Installations:  
- To preserve settings from other ComfyUI installations, place the following files in the same folder as the installer.  
They will be copied automatically to the appropriate folders:  
  - `extra_model_paths.yaml` (refer to **Extra Model Paths Maker ðŸ”¥**)  
  - `run_nvidia_gpu.bat`  
  - `comfy.settings.json` (user/default)  
  - `config.ini` (Manager)  
  - `styles.json` (was-node-suite)  
  - `was_suite_config.json` (was-node-suite)  
  - `rgthree_config.json` (rgthree)

## Extra Model Paths Maker ðŸ”¥  

### How to Use:  
1. Place **Extra_Model_Paths_Maker.bat** in your existing **models** folder and run it.  
   - This generates an organized `extra_model_paths.yaml` listing all subfolders in the directory.  
2. Move `extra_model_paths.yaml` to your new **ComfyUI** folder.  
   - This allows ComfyUI to use your existing model files without additional downloads.  

> **Note**: Some folders like **LLM** and **llm_gguf** cannot be redirected using this method.
