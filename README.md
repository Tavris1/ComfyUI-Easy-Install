## How to Use
- Download and Extract [ComfyUI-Easy-Install](https://github.com/Tavris1/ComfyUI-Easy-Install/releases/latest/download/ComfyUI-Easy-Install.zip) to the desired folder and run **ComfyUI-Easy-Install.bat**.
  - If you have a previous installation and wish to retain your settings, place these files alongside the installer.\
  They will be automatically copied into the appropriate '**ComfyUI**' folders.
    - **run_nvidia_gpu.bat**
    - **extra_model_paths.yaml**
    - **comfy.settings.json** (user/default)
    - **config.ini** (Manager)
    - **styles.json** (was-node-suite)
    - **was_suite_config.json** (was-node-suite)
    - **rgthree_config.json**
- If another '**ComfyUI_windows_portable**' folder is found, the Installer will **stop** to avoid conflicts.
  - Simply relocate the Installer to a different folder and rerun it.
- After installation, you can **move** or **rename** the '**ComfyUI_windows_portable**' folder.

## Extra Model Paths Maker (new)

- Place the **Extra_Model_Paths_Maker.bat** file within your shared **models** directory, then execute it.
  - This will generate an **extra_model_paths.yaml** file containing an organized list of all your models subfolders.
- Once generated, move **extra_model_paths.yaml** to your new **ComfyUI** folder.
  - By doing so, you'll avoid re-downloading the models files, as ComfyUI will reference your existing **models** directory structure directly.
- Note that folders like **LLM** and **llm_gguf** cannot be redirected this way.
