## Extra Model Paths Maker ðŸ”¥newðŸ”¥

1. Place the **Extra_Model_Paths_Maker.bat** file in your shared **models** directory, then run it.
   - This will create an **extra_model_paths.yaml** file with an organized list of all subfolders within your **models** directory.
2. Move **extra_model_paths.yaml** to your new **ComfyUI** folder.
   - This allows ComfyUI to directly reference your existing **models** structure without requiring additional downloads.
> **Note**: Folders like **LLM** and **llm_gguf** cannot be redirected using this method.
